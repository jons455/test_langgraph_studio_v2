This ensures that the data can be properly read by Siemens as a comma delimited CSV file is a widely supported format and UTF-8 is a commonly used character encoding. The data is comma delimited, meaning that each field or column of data is separated by a comma making it easy to read and parse the data.\nNote: Please be mindful that contents itself, such as a street address, does not include a comma. If it does, this will cause an error with the processing of the data. When a cell contains a comma, the entire cell value should be enclosed in double quotes to indicate that the comma is part of the cell contents and not a separator between fields. However, please ensure that there are no double quotes around fields that contain numbers (fields with data type number in the input file documentation), or those will be interpreted as text. There should be a dedicated column for each field in the data set. Each file must start with a header row containing the exact same technical field names that were provided by Siemens. Because the data file is processed based on the technical field names in the header, the columns can be organized in any particular order.\nNote: At least some versions of Microsoft Excel, when saving .csv files to UTF-8 (comma delimited) format, will automatically include a Byte Order Mark (BOM). This will cause a problem when the data is uploaded, leading to an error message, that the column header for the first column (typically distributor_sender_ID) is missing and that there is an extra column starting with '\\uffef' (which is the BOM). This can be solved by opening the file in an editor (Windows notepad will do) and, without editing it in any way, saving it as .csv in UTF-8 format without BOM.\nYou can scroll horizontal to see wider content.",

Transliterated or translated version is stored in the international address version.\nCase Sensitivity\nAddresses for Business Partners customers and suppliers with the country code \"GB\" will be stored in the following way:\nNames should be written as represented in the respective register of companies, cooperatives, associations or partnerships (https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/).\nLegal forms have to be abbreviated or written out according to the table in the 'Legal Forms' chapter\nPostal information (postal code, city, street) should be written according to the rules of UK Royal Mail and outlined by the Universal Postal Union (UPU)\nUpper/ lower cases should be written according to these rules.\nSpecial characters are not used.\nAddresses for foreign customers and suppliers are to be written as defined by the respective country-specific rules alignment.\nNames\nName1 (CAP) will be exchanged with Name1 (CMD).\nName2 (CAP) will be exchanged with Name2 (CMD).\nName3 won’t be exchanged with CMD because it reflects the brand name.\nIf the name is longer than 35 characters there should be made a reasonable line break. The second part of the name is stored in Name 2.\n​​​​​​​Additional information such as organizational units, contact persons or ship-to information have to be migrated to field which is not exchanged with CMD.\nNames of business partners have to be maintained according to the official trade register. Exceptions are sole trade businesses, hospitals, schools, government, and other public institutions (See the chapter Legal form).\nThe CAP GB trades with a lot of individual persons and sole trading and partnership style businesses. The names provided by the CAP GB for these businesses do not have Ltd or Plc etc. at the end of them, which means they have no legal form.\nIt is often the case that a sole trader will have the same name as a registered legal entity, but it is not correct to assume that they are the same. Therefore, CMD must not change or suggest to change the legal form on a sole trading business following confirmation the GB CAP of the correct business name.\nPlease note that “full stops” should not be placed at the end of any legal entity names. This is not relevant for GB company names.\nAbbreviations in the name\nNames of customers and suppliers with the country code \"GB\" can be abbreviated or written out.\nLegal forms\nThe legal form for Business Partners from Great Britain and Northern Ireland is mandatory and it is part of the name according to trade register.\nGenerally legal names have to contain legal forms with the following exceptions:\njoint partnerships,\nmedical institutions, imaging centers\ngovernment agencies and institutions\nlawyers\nnon-profit organizations\neducational institutions\nsole proprietors\ntrusts, foundation\nSole Trading Businesses\nIn GB we do not use Proprietor name, therefore this is not required to be entered anywhere in GB address.\nSole trade businesses, partnerships do not have legal form\nIt is often the case that a sole trader will have the same name as a registered legal entity, but it is not correct to assume that they are the same.\nExample:\nMansion House Dental Practice        X         Mansion House Dental Practice Limited\n(sole trader)                                                    (registered company)\nHospitals\nThey are mainly operated by trusts (in case of governmental hospitals). Therefore Name 1 must include the Trust Name, Name 2 can contain a Hospital Name and it is also correct to leave it empty (if there is a NHS Trust but not a separate Hospital Name).\nExample:\nName 1 = The Royal Hospitals NHS Trust\nName 2 = Royal London Hospital\nThe Legal Forms list below might not be complete but is showing the commonly used legal forms. Standard ISO 20275 is providing a full list of available legal forms of the covered countries. If an unknown Legal Form is requested for a business partner the ISO standard can be used as a reference. Please raise a change request to get missing legal forms added.\nAbbreviation of legal forms\nLegal forms for customers and vendors can be abbreviated or written out according to the following table which contain the most used legal forms:\nGreat Britain and Northern Ireland is covered by the ISO Standard ISO standard 20275 ‘Financial Services – Entity Legal Forms (ELF)’, developed by the International Organization for Standardization. The standard was published in July 2017. Each Legal Form covered by the Standard got a so-called ELF code assigned which uniquely identifies the legal form. ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\nAddress Data\nAs a general rule postal information, e.g. postal code, city, street, should be written according to the rules of UK Royal Mail.\nStreet\n\"Street\" is a mandatory field.\nThe street can be verified in UK Royal Mail.\nThe street field is purely for street information only, but also a House name is part of the address. House name is currently not exchanged with CMD.\nNo Unit Numbers will be stored in the Street Field.\nHouse name /Industrial Estates /Business parks must only be used as the last resort when there is no alternative street information available.

The leading zero is omitted in some places. A Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) registered in England and Wales will begin with ‘OC’ followed by 6 numbers.\nThe company registration number for limited companies in Scotland begins with ‘SC’ followed by 6 digits. The format for Scottish LLPs begins ‘SO’ followed by 6 digits.\nSimilarly, limited companies based in Northern Ireland are identified by ‘NI’ followed by 6 digits. There are also some older Northern Irish companies with company registration numbers beginning ‘R’ followed by 7 digits, but no new numbers are issued on this basis. LLPs registered in Northern Ireland have references beginning ‘NC’ followed by 6 numbers.\nThere are several other forms of company registration number, but these tend to apply to specialised type of company (e.g. Royal Charter companies begin ‘RC’) or are historic references that are no longer used for new companies. [2]\nTax Identifiers (SALESTAX_ID)\nThe following Tax Numbers can be used for Business Partners in Great Britain and Northern Ireland. UK tax numbers are not mandatory to be entered.\nBrexit impact\nAfter Brexit the GB VAT IDs assigned to Business Partners from the United Kingdom are not valid any longer for EU intra-community transactions. Hence, it has been decided by CF T 6 to remove the numbers from the VAT field in the master data (technical field in vendor accounts: LFA1-STCEG, customer accounts: KNA1-STCEG). e GB VAT IDs are still valid within UK and HMRC (Her Majesty's Revenue & Customs; UK Tax Authorities) did not revoke the numbers after Brexit.\nIf maintained the number will in CMD not be stored in the VAT number field (STCEG; Tax Number Category GB0). SALESTAX_ID has been mapped in the CMD system to Tax Number 4 (Tax Number Category GB4).\nHandling of GB VAT IDs (domestic tax number)\nIf entered the British Tax IDs is entered with 'GB' prefix.\nThe British GB VAT IDs can be verified using following HMRC website: \nhttps://www.gov.uk/check-uk-vat-number\nHandling of XI VAT IDs (Northern Ireland Protocol)\n-> Can only be maintained locally but not in CMD Layer\n​​​​​​​\nIn context of Brexit the Government of the United Kingdom and The European Commission agreed a so-called Northern Ireland protocol. Under this protocol customs checks are performed for goods on the boarder between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. Under specific circumstances such transactions can be executed under the EU tax regime. To identify legitimate business partners accordingly a new EU VAT ID category has been agreed which is prefixed with 'XI'.\nThe XI VAT Numbers can be verified using the VIES tax number verification service of the European Union: \nhttps://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/vatRequest.html\nFormat\nIf available, the numbers should be entered without spaces.\nHint\n​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Due to technical limitations the number cannot be exchanged with CMD at the moment. These number need to be locally maintained.",

Institutions and entities assigned a GIIN can use it to identify themselves to withholding agents and tax administrators for FATCA reporting purposes.\nThe GIIN, formatted as XXXXXX.XXXXX.XX.XXX, is a 19-character identification number made up of several identifiers. These characters will never contain the letter “O”.\n​​​​​​​Special handling required in case a Social Security Number is provided by Customer or Vendor\nUSA: Social Security Number (SSN)\nThe SSN in the US is a identification number assigned to an Individual and underlies specific US Data Privacy regulations and need to be treated restrictively. The SSN might be provided along with supporting tax payer identification documentation (so-called W-9) form.\n! The only case where the W-9 form should be accepted with a SSN on it is, if the check-box \"Individual/sole proprietor or singe-member LLC\" is ticked !\nIf a W-9 form is submitted by the Business Partner and any other box is ticked, a corrected/ updated W-9 form needs to be requested from the vendor or customer. The SSN Number should not be recorded in our systems (except mentioned box is ticked and legal form of the supplier/customer fits to it). Once the corrected W-9 form is received, the version containing the SSN number should be deleted from our systems. it\nExemplary W-9 form\nThe Social Security Number format is XXX-XX-XXXX.",
